# React Todo-shoppingList App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This Application allows the user to create their own
shopping list and mark items as completed and view both categories.

Welcome screen will pop up if it is the first time the user enter the app or the shopping list is empty.

Click the add item button to create your first item.
Click the checkbox to mark the item as completed.
You can also sort the list by name or size.
